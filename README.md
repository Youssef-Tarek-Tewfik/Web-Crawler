[Web Engineering Course Project] C# ASP.NET Application that recursively fetches documents gathering all the text data under \<p> paragraphs and later using this data for indexing. The crawler class and its functions are parameterized to accept a variable amount of documents to be visited as well as the maximum number of threads, and the starting point for the crawler. Before indexing, each word is stemmed and then the list is saved into a .txt file.
